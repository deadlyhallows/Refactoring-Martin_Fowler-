Write a program to calculate and print a statement of a
customer's charges at a video store. The program is told which movies a customer rented and for
how long. It then calculates the charges, which depend on how long the movie is rented, and
identifies the type movie. There are three kinds of movies: regular, children's, and new releases.
In addition to calculating charges, the statement also computes frequent renter points, which vary
depending on whether the film is a new release.
